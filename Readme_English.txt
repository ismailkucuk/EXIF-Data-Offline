Disclaimer: This script is for educational purposes only.
Do not use against any photos that you don't own or have authorization to test.
Note most social media sites strip exif data from uploaded photos.

//This program extracts EXIF data offline.

To Use:
Select the desired language option.
Then enter the file directory.
For example "C:/Data/exif_resim.jpg". (Note the colon (:), slash (/) and the file extension).
The EXIF data will then be saved in the same directory as the image.
In addition to the EXIF data, at the bottom of the saved .txt file there is a Google Maps link to the location where the photo was taken.
